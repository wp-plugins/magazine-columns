4. Use the `column` quicktag in the HTML editor to add the &lt;!--column--&gt; tag to your posts or pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

1) How do I create columns in my posts or pages?

Just add &lt;!--column--&gt; to your posts or pages with the `column` quicktag button in the HTML editor or add it manually. 

2) How do I create more columns?

Just add the &lt;!--column--&gt; tag to your post or pages up to four times to create up to five columns.

3) What if I only want a portion of my post or page to have columns.

Place `&lt;!--startcolumns--&gt;` where you want your columns to begin, and `&lt;!--stopcolumns--&gt;`  where you would like them to end. Then add the &lt;!--column--&gt; tag within these tags to divide your text.
